			<p> My name is Nilawan Laolee. My Student ID is 622115020. My friends calls me Ni. I'm 19 years old now and currently study in
 first year at Faculty of CAMT majored in Software Engineering. The reasons I choose to study
 software engineering is I like to learn about the computer languages like, c++ or
 JAVA. Plus it is my advantage thai I know more about coding than other people so, software engineering really
 suits me.
